# trivia-take-two

This is a trivia game demonstrating the creation of elements via javascript/jQuery and functional comparitive loops. The timer is buggy and tracks multiple values for the same variable simultaneously, something that seems to me should not be possible. I spent a number of hours trying to debug this issue and it's no longer practical. The countdown clock solutions from week 2 or 3 or whatever are no longer in our class repo and available internet resources have not yet been helpful. The app has not been styled. I would like to be graded on what was turned in, rather than riding this as an incomplete.
